    <string name="measu_title">MEASUREMENT</string>
    <string name="measurement">The classic style road bike frame is most commonly found on road, racing, touring, and commuting bikes. The top tube is parallel to the road,
                                 giving the frame more stability and support. The frame size is determined by measuring the length of the seat tube, in centimeters.
                                 The instructions below explain how to measure a classic road bike.</string>
